A library for mapping points between different sized coordinates systems. Translates points from your specific coordinatesystem to a HTML canvas in desired dimension.  

## Usage

// Example: A coordinate system with x and y in range [400, 600] respectively. Both axes are normallyc scaled. Also the y-axis is in opposite direction of a standard cartesian system.


polygon = new Polygon([506.47,
